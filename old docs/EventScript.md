## Language Overview

EventScript uses a simple `triggerExpression => action` syntax where:
- **Triggers** define when a rule should execute
- **Actions** define what should happen when triggered
- **Properties** provide access to device states and controls

## Basic Syntax

```lua
rule("triggerExpression => action")
```

Rules are defined using the `rule()` function with a string containing the trigger-action pattern.
The trigger is an expression returning true or false, and when true the action is executed. It can thus be thought of as
```lua
IF trigger THEN action END
```
The trigger must be an "pure" expression and not contain any control statements or side effects. Ex. assignments or print statemenets. The reason being that while compiling the rules, the trigger part may be evaluated multiple times.
The trigger part is inspected during compilation to find out what events causes the rule to be triggered. Ex. if an fibaro global variable or a device property is used as part of the expression, the rule will trigger when those change in the system.

## Control Structures

EventScript supports standard control flow structures for implementing complex logic within rules.

### Conditional Statements

Use conditional statements to execute code based on conditions:

```lua
-- Simple if statement
if <test> then 
  <statements> 
end

-- If-else statement
if <test> then 
  <statements> 
else 
  <statements> 
end

-- If-elseif-else statement (elseif can be repeated)
if <test> then 
  <statements> 
elseif <test2> then 
  <statements> 
else 
  <statements> 
end

case
  || <test> >> <statements>
  || <test> >> <statements>
  :
  || <test> >> <statements>
end
```

**Examples:**
```lua
rule("sensor:breached => if luxSensor:value < 100 then light:on end")
rule("@sunset => if house:isAllOff then alarm:arm else log('House not secure') end")
```

### Loop Statements

EventScript supports various loop constructs:

```lua
-- Numeric for loop
for i = 1, n[, step] do 
  <statements> 
end

-- Iterator for loop (arrays)
for _, v in ipairs(<list>) do 
  <statements> 
end

-- Iterator for loop (tables)
for k, v in pairs(<table>) do 
  <statements> 
end

-- While loop
while <test> do 
  <statements> 
end

-- Repeat-until loop
repeat 
  <statements> 
until <test>
```

**Examples:**
```lua
rule("@08:00 => for i=1,5 do lights[i]:on end")
rule("motionDetected => for _,light in ipairs(hallwayLights) do light:on end")
```

## Assignment

EventScript supports various assignment patterns for working with variables and values.

### Simple Assignment

Assign values to variables using the assignment operator:

```lua
var = <expr>
```

**Examples:**
```lua
rule("sensor:temp => temperature = sensor:temp")
rule("@morning => lightLevel = 80")
```

### Multiple Assignment

Assign multiple values in a single statement:

```lua
var1, var2, ..., varn = expr1, expr2, ...
```

Functions can return multiple values, with the last expression supporting multiple return values:

```lua
var1, var2, var3 = 42, (function() return 3, 4 end)()
```

**Examples:**
```lua
rule("weatherUpdate => temp, humidity = weatherStation:temp, weatherStation:humidity")
```

## Tables

Tables are the primary data structure in EventScript, used for arrays, dictionaries, and complex data organization.

### Table Creation

Create tables using various syntaxes:

```lua
-- Array-style table
local v = { <expr1>, <expr2>, ..., <exprn> }

-- Dictionary-style table
local v = { <key1> = <expr1>, <key2> = <expr2>, ..., <keyn> = <exprn> }

-- Mixed table with computed keys
local v = { [<expr1>] = <expr2>, [<expr3>] = <expr4>, ..., [<exprn>] = <exprm> }
```

**Examples:**
```lua
-- Device groups
livingRoomLights = {66, 67, 68}
deviceStates = { motion = false, door = "closed", temp = 22 }
sensorMap = { [101] = "kitchen", [102] = "bedroom" }
```

### Table Access

Access and modify table values:

```lua
-- Dot notation (for string keys)
<table>.<key> = <expr>
value = <table>.<key>

-- Bracket notation (for any key type)
<table>[<expr>] = <expr>
value = <table>[<expr>]
```

**Examples:**
```lua
rule("motion:breached => deviceStates.motion = true")
rule("temp:value => sensorData[temp:id] = temp:value")
```

## Expressions

Expressions in EventScript are used to create complex trigger conditions and perform calculations within rules.

### Variables

EventScript supports both local and global variables with a specific scope resolution order.

#### Variable Declaration

```lua
-- Local variables (scoped to the current rule)
local v1, ..., vn [= expr1, ..., exprn]

-- Global variables (accessible across all rules)
v1, ..., vn [= expr1, ..., exprn]
```

#### Variable Resolution Order

When accessing a variable, EventScript checks in this order:
1. **Local EventScript variable** (rule-scoped)
2. **Global EventScript variable** (system-wide)
3. **Global Lua variable** (built-in functions and constants)

#### Variable Assignment

When assigning to a variable that doesn't exist, EventScript creates an EventScript Global variable by default.

**Examples:**
```lua
rule("@08:00 => local brightness = 80; lights:value = brightness")
rule("sensor:temp => temp = sensor:temp")  -- Creates global variable
rule("motion:breached => if temp > 25 then fan:on end")  -- Uses global variable
```

### Constants

EventScript provides various types of constants for use in expressions.

#### Time Constants

Time values can be specified in `HH:MM:SS` or `HH:MM` format:

```lua
rule("sensor:breached & 23:00..05:00 => log('Breached at night')")
rule("@@00:00:10 => log('Ping every 10 seconds')")
```

#### Time Representation

- **Short times**: Times between 00:00 and 24:00, represented as seconds after midnight
- **Long times**: Epoch times (like Lua's `os.time()`) for absolute timestamps

An absolue long time [YEAR]/MONTH/DAY/HOUR.MIN[:SEC]
```lua
rule("post(#futureEvent,2027/10/04/23:00)")  -- Post October 4, 23:00 2025
rule("post(#futureEvent,/12/23/18:00)")  -- Post on Xmas eve, this year
rule("#futureEvent => log('Future event'))")
```

Note that long times can't be compared to short times. To convert a long time to a short time, subtract midnight. Normally, need for such calculations are rare.


#### Predefined Constants

| Constant | Type | Description |
|----------|------|-------------|
| `sunset` | Short time | Sunset time, updates daily at midnight |
| `sunrise` | Short time | Sunrise time, updates daily at midnight |
| `dawn` | Short time | Dawn time, updates daily at midnight |
| `dusk` | Short time | Dusk time, updates daily at midnight |
| `now` | Short time | Current time (HH:MM:SS) |
| `midnight` | Long time | Midnight timestamp, updates daily |
| `wnum` | Number | Current week number |

**Examples:**
```lua
rule("@sunset => outdoorLights:on")
rule("sensor:breached & sunrise..sunset => securityAlert()")
rule("wnum % 2 == 0 => weeklyMaintenance()")  -- Every other week
```

### Operators

EventScript supports various operators for building complex expressions.

#### Logical Operators

| Operator | Description | Example |
|----------|-------------|---------|
| `&` | Logical AND | `sensor:breached & 22:00..06:00` |
| `\|` | Logical OR | `door:open \| window:open` |
| `!` | Logical NOT | `!alarm:armed` |

#### Arithmetic Operators

| Operator | Description | Example |
|----------|-------------|---------|
| `+` | Addition | `temp1:value + temp2:value` |
| `-` | Subtraction | `sunset - 00:30` |
| `*` | Multiplication | `price * quantity` |
| `/` | Division | `total / count` |
| `%` | Modulo | `minute % 15 == 0` |
| `^` | Exponentiation | `base ^ power` |

#### Comparison Operators

| Operator | Description | Example |
|----------|-------------|---------|
| `==` | Equal | `temp:value == 22` |
| `!=` or `~=` | Not equal | `door:state != "closed"` |
| `<` | Less than | `lux:value < 100` |
| `<=` | Less or equal | `humidity <= 60` |
| `>` | Greater than | `temp:value > 25` |
| `>=` | Greater or equal | `battery >= 20` |

#### Assignment Operators

| Operator | Description | Example |
|----------|-------------|---------|
| `+=` | Add and assign | `counter += 1` |
| `-=` | Subtract and assign | `energy -= consumption` |
| `*=` | Multiply and assign | `scale *= factor` |
| `/=` | Divide and assign | `average /= count` |

#### Coalesce Operator
| Operator | Description | Example |
|----------|-------------|---------|
| `??` | Assign if not nil | `counter = a ??` 7 |

**Examples:**
```lua
rule("temp:value > 25 & humidity < 60 => fan:on")
rule("@sunset-00:30 => lights:on")  -- 30 minutes before sunset
rule("motion:breached => counter += 1; log('Motion count: %d', counter)")
```

##Triggers

Triggers define the conditions under which rules should execute.
The triggerExpression part of a rule can be a complex expression of triggers returning true or false

### Daily Triggers

Execute rules at specific times during the day:

```lua
rule("@time => action")                    -- Trigger at specific time
rule("@{time1,time2,...} => action")      -- Trigger at multiple times
rule("@{time,catch} => action")           -- Catchup: Run if deployed after time
rule("12:00..sunset => action")           -- Time interval guard, mostly part of more complex triggers
```
Daily triggers can only specify a time during the day. To invoke the rule and specific days add a guard to the triggerExpression to test that it is the right day.

**Examples:**
```lua
rule("@08:00 => lights:on")               -- Turn on lights at 8 AM
rule("@{07:00,19:00} => securityCheck()")   -- Check security at 7 AM and 7 PM
rule("@sunset => outdoorLights:on")       -- Turn on outdoor lights at sunset
rule("@15:00 & day('mon-fri') => outdoorLights:on") -- Turn on outdoor lights at 15:00 or weekdays 
```

### Interval Triggers

Execute rules at regular intervals:

```lua
rule("@@00:05 => action")     -- Every 5 minutes
rule("@@-00:05 => action")    -- Every 5 minutes, aligned to clock
```

**Examples:**
```lua
rule("@@00:15 => temperatureCheck()")       -- Check temperature every 15 minutes
rule("@@-01:00 => hourlyReport()")          -- Generate report on the hour
```

### Event Triggers

Respond to custom events:

```lua
rule("#myEvent => action")                -- Trigger on custom event
rule("#myEvent{param=value} => action")   -- Trigger on event with parameters
```

**Examples:**
```lua
rule("#myEvent => temperatureCheck()")       -- Check temperature when getting #MyEvent
rule("@sunset => post(#myEvent)")            --POst #MyEvent at sunset
```

> **Note:** `#event` is shorthand for `{type='event'}`, and `#event{k1=v1,...}` expands to `{type='event', k1=v1, ...}`

**Event matching**
```lua
rule("#myEvent{x=42} => log('x is %s',env.event.x)")  -- Trigger on event with parameters
rule("post(#myEvent{x=42})")                      -- Post event with parameters
```
Note: the event that triggers the rule is available in the local variable ev.event.

```lua
rule("#myEvent{x='$v'} => log('x is %s',env.p.v)")  -- Trigger on event with pattern match
rule("post(#myEvent{x=42})")                      -- Post event with parameters
```
Values of type string and starting with prefix '\$' is considered a pattern, and will bind the variable after the '\$' to the value if there is a match. Matched variables are available in env.p.*

```lua
rule("#myEvent{x='$v>8'} => log('x is %s',env.p.v)")  -- Trigger on event with pattern match
rule("post(#myEvent{x=9})")                      -- Post event with parameters
```
Patterns can also have an operator constraints applied. The trigger event only match, and the local variable is bound, if the constraint is true.
In the above example v must be greater than 8 for the trigger event to match.
Possible operators are
| Operator | Description | Example |
|----------|-------------|---------|
| `$var>value` | value greater than | `#ev{key="$v>8"}` |
| `$var<value` | value less than | `#ev{key="$v<8"}` |
| `$var>=value` | value greater or equal than | `#ev{key="$v>=8"}` |
| `$var<=value` | value greater or less than | `#ev{key="$v<=8"}` |
| `$var~=value` | value differs from | `#ev{key="$v~=8"}` |
| `$var==value` | value equal | `#ev{key="$v==8"}` |
| `$var<>value` | value string match | `#ev{key="$m<>date.*"}` |

### Device Triggers

React to device state changes:

```lua
rule("device:property => action")         -- Single device trigger
rule("{dev1,dev2,...}:property => action") -- Multiple device trigger
```

**Examples:**
```lua
rule("motionSensor:value => hallLight:on")
rule("{door1,door2,window1}:breached => alarm:on")
```

### Trigger Variables

Use custom variables as triggers:

```lua
er.triggerVariables.x = 9    -- Define trigger variable
rule("x => action")          -- Trigger when x changes
rule("x = 42")              -- Change x to trigger above rule
```

## Functions

### trueFor Function

Execute actions when conditions remain true for a specified duration:

```lua
rule("trueFor(duration, condition) => action")
```

**Examples:**
```lua
rule("trueFor(00:05, sensor:safe) => light:off")
-- Turn off light when sensor has been safe for 5 minutes

rule("trueFor(00:10, door:open) => log('Door open for %d minutes', 10*again(5))")
-- Log message with again(n) re-enabling the condition n times
```

### Date Functions

Date functions allow you to test properties of the current day and time ranges.

#### Day Testing Functions

```lua
wday('wed-thu,sun')     -- Test current weekday
day('1,13-last')        -- Test current day of month
month('jul-sep')        -- Test current month
date('* 10-12 * 8 *')   -- Full date/time test (min,hour,day,month,wday)
```

**Day Function Syntax:**
- `day('1,13-last')` - 'last' refers to the last day in month
- `day('1,lastw-last')` - First day and last week in month (lastw = last day - 6)

**Examples:**
```lua
rule("@15:00 & wday('mon-fri') => workdayRoutine()")     -- Weekday schedule
rule("@08:00 & day('1') => monthlyReport()")             -- First day of month
rule("@sunset & month('dec-feb') => winterLights:on")    -- Winter months
rule("@12:00 & date('* * 1,15 * *') => biweeklyCheck()") -- 1st and 15th of month
```

#### Time Range Testing

```lua
<time1>..<time2>       -- Test if current time is between times (inclusive)
```

**Examples:**
```lua
rule("motion:breached & 22:00..06:00 => nightLight:on")  -- Night hours
rule("door:open & sunrise..sunset => dayAlert()")        -- Daytime hours

## Examples

### Basic Device Control
```lua
rule("@08:00 => livingRoomLights:on")           -- Morning lights
rule("motionSensor:breached => hallwayLight:on") -- Motion activation
rule("@sunset => {porch,garden,driveway}:on")   -- Evening outdoor lights
```

### Conditional Logic
```lua
rule("door:isOpen & @sunset => securityLight:on")      -- Security at sunset
rule("trueFor(00:10, house:isAllOff) => alarm:arm")    -- Auto-arm when quiet
rule("luxSensor:value < 100 & motion:breached => lights:on") -- Smart lighting
```

### Time-based Automation
```lua
rule("@{07:00,19:00} => thermostat:mode='auto'")        -- Twice daily schedule
rule("22:00..06:00 & motion:breached => nightLight:on") -- Night mode
rule("@@00:30 => hvac:refresh")                         -- Regular maintenance
```

### List Operations
```lua
rule("temperatureSensors:average > 25 => fan:on")       -- Climate control
rule("{sensor1,sensor2,sensor3}:someTrue => alert:on")  -- Multi-sensor alert
rule("allLights:isAnyOff => log('Some lights are off')") -- Status monitoring
```

### Advanced Scenarios
```lua
-- Vacation mode
rule("$vacationMode == true & motion:breached => securityAlert")

-- Energy saving
rule("trueFor(01:00, room:isAllOff) => hvac:targetLevel=18")

-- Weather-based automation
rule("weatherStation:temp < 0 & @06:00 => carHeater:on")
```

## Rule management functions

Defining a rules returns a rule object, that has methods for managing and controling the rule
```lua
local r = rule("triggerExpression => actions")

r.disable() -- disables the rule and stops all timers started by the rule

r.enable() -- enables the rule. A daily or interval rule will start to run

r.start() -- trigger the rule manually

r.info() -- logs info about the rule
```

​
A rule has a life-cycle, or states, that it passes through.
1. Defined, when a rule is defined/created.
2. When a rule is started/triggered
3. If the trigger expression (condition) of the rule succeeded or failed, if succeeded the action will run
4. Optionally, the rule can wait, be suspended, and later woken up. Typically with the wait(time) command.
5. The action of the rule can produce a result
  
When a rule is defined and triggered there are logs created in the console for the above states. We can tailor them to our own look&feel.
```lua
er.opts = {
    started = boolean/function, -- true => system start log, alt. user function(rule,env,trigger)
    check = boolean/function,   -- true => system check log, alt. user function(rule,env,cond result)
    result = boolean/function,  -- true => system result log, alt. user function(rule,result)
    triggers = boolean,         -- list triggers when rule defined
    waiting = boolean/function, -- true => system waiting log, alt. user function(rule,env,time)
    waited = boolean/function,  -- true => system waited log, alt. user function(rule,env,time)
    defined = boolean/function,  -- true => log rule defined, alt. user function(rule)
    ruleDefPrefix = "✅",       -- prefix string for rule defined result
    triggerListPrefix = "⚡",    -- prefix string for listed rule triggers
    dailyListPrefix = "🕒",     -- prefix string for listed rule dailys
    startPrefix = "🎬",         -- prefix string for rule started/triggered
    successPrefix = "👍",       -- prefix string for rule check/success
    failPrefix = "👎",          -- prefix string for rule check/fail
    resultPrefix = "📋",        -- prefix string for rule result
    errorPrefix = "❌",         -- prefix string for rule compile error
    waitPrefix = "💤",          -- prefix string for rule waiting/sleep notification
    waitedPrefix = "⏰",        -- prefix string for rule waited/awake notification
} 
```
The prefix strings shown are the defaults, and boolean/functions are set to false as default.

If we turn on all flags we get
```lua
  rule("#foo => wait(10); return 77")
  rule("post(#foo)")
```
```bash
[04.09.2025][08:12:58][DEBUG  ][ER65555]: Rule 1 triggers: -- Listing trigger, opts.triggers = true
[04.09.2025][08:12:58][DEBUG  ][ER65555]: ⚡ #foo{}         -- Event trigger, opts.triggerListPrefix = "⚡"
[04.09.2025][08:12:58][DEBUG  ][ER65555]: ✅ [Rule:1] #foo => wait(10); return 77 -- opts.ruleDefPrefix = "✅"
[04.09.2025][08:12:58][DEBUG  ][ER65555]: =========== Load time: 0.010s ============
[04.09.2025][08:12:59][DEBUG  ][ER65555]: 🎬 [Rule:1]: #foo{}  -- opts.started = true, opts.startPrefix = "🎬"
[04.09.2025][08:12:59][DEBUG  ][ER65555]: 👍 [Rule:1]          -- opts.check = true, opts.successPrefix = "👍"
[04.09.2025][08:12:59][DEBUG  ][ER65555]: 💤 [Rule:1]: ⏰08:13:09 -- opts.waiting = true, opts.waitPrefix = "💤"
[04.09.2025][08:13:09][DEBUG  ][ER65555]: ⏰ [Rule:1]: awake      -- opts.waited = true, opts.waitedPrefix = "⏰"
[04.09.2025][08:13:09][DEBUG  ][ER65555]: 📋 [Rule:1]: 77         -- opts.result = true, opts.resultPrefix = "📋"
```
  
To get a reasonable log we start in main by setting some of the flags.
```lua
er.opts = { started = true, check = true, triggers = true }
```
Then we get the triggers listed for a defined rule - always good to see if it will react to the events we had in mind.
We get a log when the rule is started and it show the event that triggered the rule
We get a log with thumbs up/down depending how the rule condition went.
  
er.pts are defined globally and are applied to all defined rules. We can override opts by giving an opts argument to rule(str,opts)

The options for the rule will be the global er.opts override with the opts we give for the rule.
```lua
rule("@sunset => lamp:on",{check=false})
```
More advanced, we can provide a log function for the rule logs.
An example. We can ignore the start message, and instead only log if the check/success of the rule is true.
```lua
er.opts = { started = true, check = true, result = false, triggers=true, }

local function check(rule, env, res)
  if res then print(string.format("%s %s",rule.successPrefix,env.trigger)) end
end

rule("#foo => wait(10); return 77",{triggers=true,started=false,check=check}) -- no start msg, and custom check
rule("post(#foo)")
```
```bash
[04.09.2025][08:30:42][DEBUG  ][ER65555]: Rule 1 triggers:  -- opts.triggers = true
[04.09.2025][08:30:42][DEBUG  ][ER65555]: ⚡ #foo{}
[04.09.2025][08:30:42][DEBUG  ][ER65555]: ✅ [Rule:1] #foo => return 77
[04.09.2025][08:30:42][DEBUG  ][ER65555]: =========== Load time: 0.011s ============
[04.09.2025][08:30:42][DEBUG  ][ER65555]: 👍 #foo{} -- No start message, only our own check with success and trigger
```

## Best Practices

1. **Use meaningful device names** in your HomeTable variables
2. **Group related devices** in lists for easier management
3. **Combine time guards** with device triggers for smarter automation
4. **Use trueFor()** to avoid false triggers from brief state changes
5. **Test rules thoroughly** before deploying to production
6. **Document complex rules** with comments in your main function
7. **Use trigger variables** for inter-rule communication
8. **Leverage list operations** for aggregated device control
